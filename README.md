# Horiseon Code Refactoring - README

## Description
The HTML and CSS for the Horiseon Landing page had a number of issues. These issues included:

1. No semantic HTML
2. Redundant CSS classes
3. No HTML title element
4. No alt text on images

The lack of semantic HTML and alt text also caused issues for accessability as it prevents screen readers working effectively.

In this project, I have corrected these issues and added comments to the HTML and CSS files of the changes made. I have loaded to the repo to GitHub Pages at the below address so you can see the page in action!
